## Development workflow

### Start the liveâ€‘reload server

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will run a local server at `http://localhost:3001` and supports hot reloading on changes to source files.

### Creating Content

To add a new page to the website, following the existing file structure for naming and organization:

```bash
mkdir src/pages/new-page
touch src/pages/new-page/NewPage.jsx
```

To add a new reusable component:

```bash
mkdir src/common/components/new-component
touch src/common/components/new-component/NewComponent.jsx
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Creates an optimized production build.

## Theming and Styling

Modify styles in `src/App.css`, the appropriate stylesheet file, or inside the `.jsx` file.
