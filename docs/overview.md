# Project Overview 

## Project Vision and Goals 
Sokana Collective is a Doula Agency that aids with training doulas to support people with all aspects of their fertility journey.

The purpose of this redesign is to maintain the current design as much as possible while integrating user-friendly practices. This involves developing an online training academy for Sokanaâ€™s Doulas. The Sokana Collective Training Academy will serve to make doula training for existing and aspiring doulas more accessible. 

The feature we focused on adding to the website was a new courses page. Users can log in and view the courses they own, as well as browse and purchase new courses. A short preview of each course is given before being prompted to pay to further watch the course. 

## Target Audience 
Our target audience is people who are interested in childbirth and doula education. Info should be easily searchable for the target audience, allowing doula training for existing and aspiring doulas to be accessible. 

Other users include admins who may want to edit page features and add or modify courses in the training academy.
